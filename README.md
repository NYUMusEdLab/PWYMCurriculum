# About PWYMCurriculum
Play With Your Music (#PWYM) is a massively open online <em>community</em> developed as an open learning and design project of the NYU Music Experience Design Lab. PWYM was developed in partnership with P2PU and artist partners Clara Berry and Peter Gabriel.

PWYM started as a course focused on the creative processes of audio engineers and producers. Today, PWYM is the umbrella for these projects hosted at http://playwithyourmusic.org.

PWYM is in the process of developing into multiple content areas:
* Play With Your Audio - A rebranding of the original PWYM course on audio engineering and production
* Play With Your Music Theory
* Play With Your Film Music
