# Getting Started with Soundation

For the final modules of Play With Your Music we will be using [Soundation Studio][1] - a free, online digital audio workstation. In Soundation, we are providing access to the stereo CD-quality stems to Peter Gabriel's songs *In Your Eyes* and *Sledgehammer*. Unlike in Module 4, you will be working with 16-bit, 44.100 kHz stereo WAV files, instead of compressed MP3s. As you work in Soundation, see if you can hear the difference between the MP3 stems you worked with in the last module vs. the Soundation WAV stems.

For this module, we are working only with sections of *In Your Eyes*. In later modules, you will have access to the full stem materials for creative mixing and remixing projects. 

To get started, sign up for a [free Soundation account here][2]. If you find Soundation to be a helpful tool for you, consider signing up for one of the subscription plans, which provides additional services, storage, and support.
