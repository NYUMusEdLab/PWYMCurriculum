 # Introduction To Play With Your Music - #PWYM
 
 Are you ready to turn it up to 11? We are. Get ready a series of awesome learning and music making modules exploring creative music production processes, modeled using the music of Peter Gabriel! This post will familiarize you with the logistics of the course, get you sorted with the tools you need, and help you get to know your fellow PWYM participants.

*#PWYM Team*

We’re Alex, Ethan, Vanessa and Dirk (collaboratively known as “Mister Mix”). You’ll see us in the PWYM community and popping up over email. Think about us as your “backup band” for the course. You’ll be learning from each other here, not us!

# Schedule

For the next 10-12 weeks, you’ll receive emails from “Mister Mix” with links to the modules in this course.  At the beginning of the week we’ll drop a line with an assignment and supporting materials.
