PWYM resident Audio FXpert [Alex Case][1], faculty member in [Sound Recording Technology at UMass Lowell][2], publisher of the blog [Recordingology][3], and [instructor of audio courses at Lynda.com][4], shares his insights into how to listen for timbre (instruments, voices, synths, etc.) and space in recorded music. This video interview was conducted back in November 2013 during the first version of PWYM that focused on the music of [Clara Berry and Wooldog][5]. Although Alex references that music, you can apply his advice to your projects.
